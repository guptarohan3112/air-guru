Air Guru is an assistive tool that combines the power of low-cost webcam based computer vision with powerful cross-platform system controls.

We aim to make technology and basic operations accessible to individuals that are have usability issues with computers, whether due to a lack of experience of where to find particular system settings, or through medical conditions like tremors and neuromotor disorders, that make it difficult to use trackpads and small buttons.

Air Guru can also be used to provide an intuitive experience for users who want to operate their device without touching it, useful in applications like cooking whilst watching a YouTube video. 

Our application aims to do this by providing gesture-based functionality in conjunction with the user's standard webcam. We have designed the application so it would be easily extensible to more gestures and controls. 

Air Guru's current gesture functionality includes: 
- Brightness control (Brightness Up and Brightness Down)
- Volume control (Volume Up and Volume Down)
- Mute control (Mute off and Mute On) 

This tool was developed using Python and a variety of system control and computer vision libraries (including OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe library for landmark detection of the hands and body)
