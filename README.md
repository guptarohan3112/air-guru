Air Guru is an assistive tool that aims to make technology more accessible to individuals that are not experienced in using computers. 

Our application aims to do this by providing gesture-based functionality in conjunction with a video camera. 

Gesture functionality includes: brightness control, volume control, and muting control. 

This tool was developed using Python and the third-party library/module called Mediafile, that was published for open-source use by Google.
